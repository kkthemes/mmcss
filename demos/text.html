A flash of light. Ignition. But without the proper mixture of oxygen and fuel, inspiration
both lives and dies in the same instant. My life, my experiences, my research; these things are fertile soil
for the great blog posts hidden within me. I carry them always and they are present when I sit down to do
my work.</p><p>But all too often, it’s a struggle. The raw material is there, but the inspiration is not. The oxygen is abundant,
but the fuel is scarce. And I’m left wondering, “How?”</p><p>How do I harvest? How do I sift and pan? How do I mine the caverns within me for intellectual and emotional gems?
How do I… write?</p><p>Or perhaps a better question is, how do you? Yes, <em>you</em>, my kindred blog reader. Surely, <em>you</em> are
                similar. Surely, <em>you’ve</em> wrestled the Great Muse down to the dusty earth, and won.</p><p>I know this: it starts before I sit down to type. Great posts begin with significant life challenges. With weighty
problems to solve. With an urgent need or a mature discontent with the way things are today. Yes, I
think all great posts begin before words are written.</p><p>So get up, reader. Walk away from your keyboard, and live.</p><p>Only then can you give life… to words.</p><h3>Default</h3><p>This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally
expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking
a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled
to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.</p><h3>Left Align</h3><p style="text-align: left;">This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it’s views. It’s favorite
color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really
is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.</p><h3>Center Align</h3><p style="text-align: center;">This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult
time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends
to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I
hear center align does take bribes.</p><h3>Right Align</h3><p style="text-align: right;">This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it’s views. It’s prefers to not be
told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for
some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it’s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football
fields away. Dead on. So boss.</p><h3>Justify Align</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake.
Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it’s place and not all cattywampus like
the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend
to put off more of an elitist attitude.</p></article></body></html>
