            <p><strong>This is an example of a standard post format</strong>.</p>
            <p>Inspiration is a spark. A flash of light. Ignition. But without the proper mixture of oxygen and fuel, inspiration
                both lives and dies in the same instant. My life, my experiences, my research; these things are fertile soil
                for the great blog posts hidden within me. I carry them always and they are present when I sit down to do
                my work.</p>
            <p>But all too often, it’s a struggle. The raw material is there, but the inspiration is not. The oxygen is abundant,
                but the fuel is scarce. And I’m left wondering, “How?”</p>
            <p>How do I harvest? How do I sift and pan? How do I mine the caverns within me for intellectual and emotional gems?
                How do I… write?</p>
            <p>Or perhaps a better question is, how do you? Yes,&nbsp;<em>you</em>, my kindred blog reader. Surely,&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;are
                similar. Surely,&nbsp;<em>you’ve</em>&nbsp;wrestled the Great Muse down to the dusty earth, and won.</p>
            <p>I know this: it starts before I sit down to type. Great posts begin with significant life challenges. With weighty
                problems to solve. With an urgent need or a mature discontent with the way things are today.&nbsp;Yes, I
                think all great posts begin before words are written.</p>
            <p>So get up, reader. Walk away from your keyboard, and live.</p>
            <p>Only then can you give life… to words.</p>
